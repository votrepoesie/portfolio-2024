                In this class project, I received a design brief to <span>1&rpar; create a new feature for Bumble</span> and <span>2&rpar; build upon the Google Material Design system.</span> 
                Thus, I discovered user needs that aligned with the business goal and created new components for the design system. 
                <br><br>
                My design focused on creating a design intervention that facilitates organic connections with people you pass by,  
                <span>enhancing the user experience by bridging digital interactions with real-world encounters.</span>

                    Based on the design brief and quantitative data,

                    I conducted secondary research through online forums, collecting various complaints from Bumble users who used BFF & BIZZ. 
                    I used the data to construct three user personas with the 5W1H method, ideating potential solutions that solved specific needs.

                    The key to solving this problem is not to incentivize users to meet up, but to make it fun and exciting for them to do so.

                The ideation process for this project was a lot of fun, because there was lot of out-of-the-box, despair-inducing, and illuminating experimentations!
                <br><br>
                Dramatics aside, this project was daunting because I have never worked with a design system before. There was a lot to cover: onboarding and introducing the feature, building out the interactions for the actual feature, as well as differentiating between free and premium features. The best way for me to keep reframing and iterating upon my idea was to receive feedback, then I’d open my sketchbook and quickly work through my logic through mind maps, user flows, and wireframes.
