            <h3>CMU Capstone Research Report</h3>
            <p class="body-text">
                In 2024, I designed the layout for the research report while working with a local school district. 
                Since our clients were educators, I went for a style that is reminiscent of high school notebooks
                to make the content more engaging to read, with elements like highlighted text, stickers, and vibrant colors.

                <p class="body-text">
                    In order to get more students invested in what the institute was doing and take classes with the postdocs, 
                    social media was the best way to reach our audience. 
                    <br><br>
                    However, academic research can seem cold and unapproachable, not to mention researchers often write about their work with their colleagues in mind. 
                    Therefore, I deemed it important to showcase the postdocs using simpler language, visuals, and connect their research to familiar topics. 
                    <br><br>
                    My social media posts resulted in a notable increase in class size and made the ongoing research projects more memorable not only to outsiders, 
                    but also made it easier for staff members to communicate with the postdocs.

            <p class="body-text">
                As a summer intern in the marketing department, I was tasked with creating a digital magazine to promote the museum's then-incoming exhibition,
                engaging online viewers by linking art historical research with contemporary issues.
                <br><br>
                To do this, I conducted 50+ hours of archival research and interpreted academic writings into accesible language and visuals, 
                grouping them under familiar topics such as fashion, interior decor, and travel.
