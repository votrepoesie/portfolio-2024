                Young adults often grapple with stress, anxiety, and self-critical thinking. These challenges hinder confidence, exacerbate anxiety and depression, and impede personal growth. In this project, we aim to help young adults overcome these challenges by creating an immersive VR experience that fosters self-compassion and emotional resilience, ultimately promoting mental well-being.

                    We explored game ideas that used bodily movements to combat negative emotions, inspired by therapeutic techniques including ACT (acceptance & commitment therapy) and EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing).

                    The core idea of our design is to allow users to confront their thoughts in a safe environment and be able to let their thoughts go, <span>and we hypothesize that physical movements can help achieve this transformational goal.</span>

                We wanted the game to be lighthearted and fun, so players don’t feel burdened by confronting their negative emotions. We want players to leave the game feeling refreshed and confident. 
                <br><br>
                Thus, we created a narrative to distance players from real life, and <span>we reframed the narrative from helping yourself to learning how to help yourself from helping others.</span>
                <br><br>
                The game takes place in a beautiful but troubled village, and players follow a storyline where they help the villagers to destroy negative thoughts. Through helping villagers, they engage with tasks to help ground them and relieve stress through bodily movements.

                    For the first task, players were instructed to do a power pose then reach out their arms to pick apples, stretching their body in the process. As they pick these apples, they read out the self-affirmative messages floating next to the apples. 
                    <br><br>
                    To quickly test the effectiveness of this interaction, we used physical props including a Christmas tree and some origami apples.

                Be scrappy. Take risks. Use whatever means to quickly test the idea and be fearless of technological constraints, because we can learn from failure and compromise. Be smart about dividing up the work among team members, and always communicate so others stay on the same page as me.
