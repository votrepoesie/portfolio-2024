                Young adults often grapple with stress, anxiety, and self-critical thinking. These challenges hinder confidence, exacerbate anxiety and depression, and impede personal growth. In this project, we aim to help young adults overcome these challenges by creating an immersive VR experience that fosters self-compassion and emotional resilience, ultimately promoting mental well-being.

                    To better understand how young adults feel about processing their emotions and their mental wellbeing, 
                    we conducted <span>six focus groups</span> with 2-3 participants each. 
                    <br><br>
                    We provided a slide deck of 50 metaphors to help them express how they think and feel.
                    Participants chose metaphors they resonated with in advance, then they shared their thoughts with the group.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, we found that <span>young adults need help with managing academic and work-related stress, which make them feel anxious and inadequate.</span>

                    We explored game ideas that used bodily movements to combat negative emotions, inspired by therapeutic techniques including ACT (acceptance & commitment therapy) and EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing).
                    <br><br>
                    The core idea of our design is to allow users to confront their thoughts in a safe environment and be able to let their thoughts go, <span>and we hypothesize that physical movements can help achieve this transformational goal.</span>

            </h2>
            <p class="body-text">
                We wanted the game to be lighthearted and fun, so players don’t feel burdened by confronting their negative emotions. We want players to leave the game feeling refreshed and confident. 
                <br><br>
                Thus, we created a narrative to distance players from real life, and <span>we reframed the narrative from helping yourself to learning how to help yourself from helping others.</span>
                <br><br>
                The game takes place in a beautiful but troubled village, and players follow a storyline where they help the villagers to destroy negative thoughts. Through helping villagers, they engage with tasks to help ground them and relieve stress through bodily movements.

                As a result, we used Wizard of Oz technique to conduct two rounds of user testing, hence, a lot of arts and crafts. The final round of testing was done with Meta Horizon World.

                    For the first task, players were instructed to do a power pose then reach out their arms to pick apples, stretching their body in the process. As they pick these apples, they read out the self-affirmative messages floating next to the apples. 
                    <br><br>
                    To quickly test the effectiveness of this interaction, we used physical props including a Christmas tree and some origami apples.

Thus, it is important to reset our expectations of how quickly our users will understand an interaction paradigm they&#39;re not accustomed to. </p>

To meet our vision, we aim to develop a fully realized virtual world with an intuitive and cohesive story. This will involve streamlining the narrative, reducing the number of characters, and focusing on a more personalized and engaging storyline. This enhanced narrative depth will draw players deeper into the VR world, making their mental health journey more relatable and impactful.</p>

                This project was my second VR attempt and the first with HCI considerations, so I was out of my comfort zone a lot, 
                but I learned to make progress in small increments and to be okay with asking for help.
                <br><br>
                After all, the best way to learn is to do.
                <br><br>
                Be scrappy. Take risks. Use whatever means to quickly test the idea and be fearless of technological constraints, because we can learn from failures and compromises.
