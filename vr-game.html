                Young adults often grapple with stress, anxiety, and self-critical thinking. These challenges hinder confidence, exacerbate anxiety and depression, and impede personal growth. In this project, we aim to help young adults overcome these challenges by creating an immersive VR experience that fosters self-compassion and emotional resilience, ultimately promoting mental well-being.

                Young adults need help managing academic and work-related stress, which causes them to feel anxious and inadequate.

                We wanted the game to be lighthearted and fun, so players don’t feel burdened by confronting their negative emotions. We want players to leave the game feeling refreshed and confident.

                Thus, we created a narrative to distance players from real life, and <span>we reframed the narrative from helping yourself to learning how to help yourself from helping others.</span>

                The game takes place in a beautiful but troubled village, and players follow a storyline where they help the villagers to destroy negative thoughts. Through helping villagers, they engage with tasks to help ground them and relieve stress through bodily movements.
