            <p class="body-text">
                Young adults often grapple with stress, anxiety, and self-critical thinking. These challenges hinder confidence, exacerbate anxiety and depression, and impede personal growth. In this project, we aim to help young adults overcome these challenges by creating an immersive VR experience that fosters self-compassion and emotional resilience, ultimately promoting mental well-being.

                Young adults need help managing academic and work-related stress, which causes them to feel anxious and inadequate.
